# Web-Scraping-Data-Extraction-and-NLP
Here are the instructions:

1. **Approach to the Solution:**
   - The solution involves building a web crawler script in Python to extract article text from specified URLs, perform text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and readability analysis.
   - Key steps include using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape web content, `nltk` for natural language processing tasks, and `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - The script is organized into functions for clarity and modularity, making it easier to understand and maintain.
   - Comments are included throughout the script to explain the purpose of each function and major steps.

2. **How to Run the .py File to Generate Output:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Make sure you have all necessary input files (e.g., `Input.xlsx`, text files), directories (`MasterDictionary`, `StopWords`, `Output_Extract`, `Output_Clean`), and dependencies installed.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `Web Crawler.py` file is located.
   - Run the script using the command:
     ```
     python "Web Crawler.py"
     ```
   - The script will execute and perform web crawling, text processing, sentiment analysis, readability analysis, and generate an Excel file named `Output_Data_Structure.xlsx` containing the analyzed data.

3. **Dependencies Required:**
   - Python: The script requires Python installed on your system.
   - Libraries:
     - `pandas`: For data manipulation and Excel file handling.
     - `requests`: For making HTTP requests to fetch web content.
     - `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing HTML content.
     - `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and syllable counting.
   
   You can install these dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 nltk
   ```
   Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary NLTK resources downloaded by running the following Python code once:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```
